# Contextual Music Crafter (CMC)

Contextual Music Crafter (CMC) is an intelligent, context-aware MIDI music generation tool that leverages the power of Google's Generative AI to compose multi-track musical pieces. Unlike simple random note generators, CMC builds songs iteratively, instrument by instrument. Each new part is intelligently composed in response to the parts that have already been written, creating cohesive and musically interesting results.

The entire creative direction of the music‚Äîfrom genre and tempo to instrumentation and musical complexity‚Äîis controlled through a single, easy-to-edit `config.yaml` file, making it accessible to both developers and musicians.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Context-Aware Composition:** The core of CMC. The AI analyzes the existing tracks before generating a new one, leading to a more coherent and "human-like" composition.
-   **Highly Configurable:** Control genre, BPM, key, scale, and instrumentation through the `config.yaml` file.
-   **Advanced Musical Intelligence:** The AI is guided by sophisticated prompts that understand musical roles (bass, harmony, melody), arrangement position, and even techniques like "call and response."
-   **Iterative Generation:** The script can be configured to generate multiple complete song variations in a single run, perfect for exploring different ideas quickly.
-   **Simple & Robust:** The script is self-contained and easy to run, with clear feedback during the generation process.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites (Git & Python)

<details>
<summary>Click here for detailed installation instructions for Git and Python.</summary>

#### **Git**
This project is managed with Git. You need it to clone the repository.
-   **Check if Git is installed:** Open your terminal or command prompt and type `git --version`. If it returns a version number, you're all set.
-   **How to install Git:** If the command is not found, download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

#### **Python & Pip**
The script runs on Python. `pip` is Python's package manager and is included with modern Python installations.
-   **Check if Python is installed:** Open your terminal and type `python --version` or `python3 --version`. You need version 3.7 or newer.
-   **How to install Python:** If you don't have it, download the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
    -   **‚≠ê Important for Windows Users:** During installation, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**. This is a very common source of errors if missed.

### Step 2: Project Setup

1.  **Get the Project Files**

    You can either clone the repository with Git (recommended) or download it as a ZIP file.
    
    **Option A (Git):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Edfred1/Contextual-Music-Crafter.git
    cd Contextual-Music-Crafter
    ```
    **Option B (ZIP):**
    - Download the ZIP from the [main repository page](https://github.com/Edfred1/Contextual-Music-Crafter) by clicking `Code` > `Download ZIP`.
    - Unzip the file and open a terminal in that directory.

2.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 3: API Key & Configuration

1.  **Open `config.yaml`** in a text editor.

2.  **Set your API Key:**
    You can get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
    Find the `api_key` field and replace `"YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY"` with your actual key.
    ```yaml
    # API Configuration
    api_key: "YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY"
    ```
    **Security Note:** It's highly recommended to use an environment variable or a secrets management tool rather than hardcoding your API key directly in the configuration file for public repositories.

3.  **Customize Your Music:**
    Adjust the parameters in `config.yaml` to define your desired musical output.

    -   `api_key`: Your Google AI API Key.
    -   `model_name`: The specific generative model to use (e.g., "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20").
    -   `inspiration`: A detailed text prompt describing the style and mood. This is the most important creative input!
    -   `genre`: The primary musical genre.
    -   `bpm`: Tempo in beats per minute.
    -   `key_scale`: The key and scale (e.g., "C minor", "F# dorian"). The `config.yaml` includes a comment with all available scales.
    -   `use_call_and_response`: (0 or 1) When enabled, melodic instruments will try to play in the gaps left by other instruments.
    -   `number_of_iterations`: The number of songs to generate in one run.
    -   `time_signature`: Set the beats per bar and the beat value.
    -   `instruments`: Define your "band." Each instrument is a list item with a `name`, a MIDI `program_num`, and a musical `role`. The order in this list determines the generation order.

    **Instrument Roles:**
    The `role` parameter guides the AI's composition for that instrument. Available roles are:
    -   `drums`: The main rhythmic foundation (kick, snare, hats).
    -   `percussion`: Complementary rhythmic elements (bongos, congas, shakers).
    -   `sub_bass`: Very deep, fundamental bass (often a sine wave).
    -   `bass`: The main, rhythmic bassline.
    -   `pads`: Atmospheric pads, long/slow chords.
    -   `atmosphere`: Similar to pads, often more textured or evolving.
    -   `texture`: Sonic textures, not necessarily melodic or rhythmic.
    -   `chords`: Defines the chord progression.
    -   `harmony`: Similar to chords, providing harmonic structure.
    -   `arp`: An arpeggio; plays chord notes sequentially.
    -   `guitar`: Versatile for riffs, melodies, or rhythmic chords.
    -   `lead`: The main melody or riff.
    -   `melody`: A secondary or supporting melody line.
    -   `vocal`: Rhythmic vocal chops or short phrases.
    -   `fx`: Sound effects, risers, impacts, etc.
    -   `complementary`: A general-purpose role.

## üéπ How to Use

1.  **Configure your desired sound** in `config.yaml`.
2.  **Run the script** from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python part_generator.py
    ```
3.  **Enter the desired length** for the composition when prompted.
4.  The script will generate the track, instrument by instrument, showing its progress in the console.
5.  The final MIDI file(s) will be saved in the project directory with a descriptive name based on your configuration (e.g., `House_Music_Funky_Bassline_Cminor_125bpm_20231027-123456.mid`).
